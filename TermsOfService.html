                <br><br>
                We may modify this TOS at any time without notice to you by posting revised TOS on our sites. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: <a href="" class="text-sky-600 hover:text-sky-800">https://www.thelawcorner.com/terms-of-service/</a>
                <br><br>
                Your use of the Service constitutes your binding acceptance of the TOS, including any modifications that we make. This Agreement will constitute a binding and enforceable agreement between you (individually and in your individual capacity as an employee, officer, agent, partner, etc. of each organization you represent in connection with any use of the Service) and LawCorner. By using the Service or any Services, you acknowledge and agree that you have fully read and agree to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, exactly as if it were printed on paper and signed by you. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety, then you must immediately stop using the Justia Web site and all Services. Although the registration process may require you to "click-through" or otherwise affirmatively agree to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement is binding on you by your use of the Justia Web site or Services, regardless of whether or not you choose to register.
                <br><br>
